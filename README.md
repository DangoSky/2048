# 2048 on the web

## Introduction
Write with jQuery

Use left, up, right, down to control the movement of the square. When two squares move to the same position, add the fractions of two squares and combine them into one. If no squares can be moved, the game ends.

This 2048 can only be played on PC, but not on mobile.

## Expected improvement
- [X] Rebuild the project in order to support for mobile gaming.
